<p class="isi2">Steven Albert JR or what is now known as fire ball answers questions raised by reporters. fire ball; being famous on youtube is my initial stage, I have a dream in 2030 to appear in an american football game on superbowll because it includes a prestigious rapper event to perform. what I did went into the community of rappers and exchanged ideas. doing rapper games every year is also a frequent one I follow and have followed three consecutive years of winning.
